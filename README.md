# ciphers
During this project I have created two programs, one in C and another in Java, to encipher plain text into cipher text, using two ciphers caesar and vigenere. I first developed the C program, with a CLI, but then decided to also implement a Java version, with a JavaFX GUI, which in currently in progress. The C program should be in good working order, but I would like to add some unit tests to the program.

This project has let me explore the different approaches that you take when using different types of languages, with C being a functional languaged, and Java on the other hand is a object oriented language.

Future plans for the project:
* Add unit tests to the C program
* Complete the development of the Java program, including the JavaFX GUI
* Add new features to one or both programs:
  * Deciphering component
