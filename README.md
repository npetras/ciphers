# ciphers
During this project I have created two programs, one in C and another in Java, to encipher plain text into cipher text,
 using two ciphers caesar and vigenere. First I developed the C program, with a CLI,
 but then decided to also implement a Java version, with a JavaFX GUI, which in currently in progress. This was because
 I wanted to explore writing the same/similar program in both a procedural and object oriented language, as well as 
 add a GUI to the program, which I wanted to create in Java since I already had some experience with JavaFX.
  
  The C program should be in good working order, but I would like to add some unit tests to the program.

This project has let me explore the different approaches that you take when using different types of languages,
 with C being a functional language, and Java on the other hand is a object oriented language. I have tried to use each 
 language's strenghts and general syle when developing the two programs.

Future plans for the project:
* Add unit tests to the C programg
* Complete the development of the Java program, including the JavaFX GUI
* Add new features to one or both programs:
  * Deciphering component
